# Developer Guide

This document describes setting up your environment, as well as installing Metering.

## Development Dependencies

- Go 1.8 or higher
- Helm CLI 2.6.2 or higher
- Make
- Docker
- Dep
- jq
- realpath
- python (2 or 3 is ***REMOVED***ne).
  - pyyaml

If you're using MacOS with homebrew you can install all of these using the
following:

```
$ brew install go kubernetes-helm make docker dep jq coreutils
$ brew install python@2
$ pip2 install pyyaml
```

## Building

To build the reporting-operator binary using your local Go:

```
make reporting-operator-bin
```

If you want to build docker images locally:

```
make docker-build-all
```

## Go Dependencies

We use [dep](https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/introduction.html) for managing
dependencies.

Dep installs dependencies into the `vendor/` directory at the
root of the repository, and to ensure everyone is using the same dependencies,
and ensure that if dependencies disappear, we commit the contents of `vendor/`
into git.

### Adding new dependencies

To add a new dependencies, you can generally follow the dep documentation.
Start by reading [https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/daily-dep.html](https://golang.github.io/dep/docs/daily-dep.html)
and you it should cover the most common things you'll be using dep for.

Otherwise, you should be able to just add a new import, and run `make vendor`
and the dependency will be installed.

When committing new dependencies, please use the following guidelines:

- Always commit changes to dependencies separately from other changes.
- Use one commit for changes to `Gopkg.toml`, and another commit for changes to
  `Gopkg.lock` and `vendor`.' Commit messages should be in the following forms:
  - `Gopkg.toml: Add new dependency $your_new_dependency`
  - `Gopkg.lock,vendor: Add new dependency $your_new_dependency`

## Developer install

Developers should generally use the [manual-install guide](../manual-install.md) as it offers the most flexibility when installing.

### Using images built by Jenkins

If you have a PR or branch being built my Jenkins, you can use the images it's publishing from each build to test out the changes that aren't in master yet.
For details on the image tag format, please follow the instructions in our [jenkins guide](jenkins.md#using-images-built-by-jenkins).
