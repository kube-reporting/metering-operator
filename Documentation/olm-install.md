# Installation using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)

Before you begin please make sure that the [Operator Lifecycle Manager][install-olm] version 0.4.0 or greater is installed in the cluster before running this guide.
It must be installed using the `upstream` method.

## Install

First, start by creating your namespace:

```
export METERING_NAMESPACE=metering
kubectl create ns $METERING_NAMESPACE
```

### Con***REMOVED***guration

All of the supported con***REMOVED***guration options are documented in [con***REMOVED***guring metering][con***REMOVED***guring-metering].
In this document, we will refer to your con***REMOVED***guration as your `metering.yaml`.

### Install Operator Metering with Con***REMOVED***guration

Installation is a two step process. First, install the Metering Helm operator. Then, install the `Metering` resource that de***REMOVED***nes the con***REMOVED***guration.

To start, download the [Metering subscription][metering-subscription] and save it as `metering.subscription.yaml`, and download your [Metering][example-con***REMOVED***g] resource and save it as `metering.yaml`.

The subscription is used by the Operator Lifecycle Management and Catalog operators to install CRDs and the Metering Helm operator.

Install the subscription into the cluster:

```
kubectl create -n $METERING_NAMESPACE -f metering.subscription.yaml
```

This causes the operator-lifecycle-manager (OLM) to create an `InstallPlan` resource named after the `Subscription`.
The `InstallPlan` references a `ClusterServiceVersion` within it's catalog which describes the Metering Helm operator Deployment, Role, ServiceAccount, and CRD resources that need to be created.
The OLM operator will read the `ClusterServiceVersion` from it's catalog, and then create a `ClusterServiceVersion` named after our `InstallPlan`.
Once the `ClusterServiceVersion` exists, the operator creates the deployment containing our Metering Helm operator.


To verify this, run the following command:

```
kubectl get -n $METERING_NAMESPACE subscription-v1s,installplan-v1s,clusterserviceversion-v1s
```

You should see something like this in the output:

```
NAME                                                           AGE
subscription-v1.app.coreos.com/metering-helm-operator.v0.6.0   4m

NAME                                                                        AGE
installplan-v1.app.coreos.com/install-metering-helm-operator.v0.6.0-jhrr4   4m

NAME                                                                    AGE
clusterserviceversion-v1.app.coreos.com/metering-helm-operator.v0.6.0   4m
```

**Note: The Subscription, and InstallPlan resources declare an intent to perform an installation once. This means they do not ensure the ClusterServiceVersion exists after creating it the ***REMOVED***rst time, and deleting them will not result in the operator being uninstalled. For details on uninstall, see [Uninstalling Metering](#uninstalling-metering).**

Finally, install the `Metering` resource, which causes the Metering Helm operator to install and con***REMOVED***gure Metering and its dependencies.

```
kubectl create -n $METERING_NAMESPACE -f metering.yaml
```

## Uninstall

The operator-lifecycle-manager (OLM) operator does not automatically uninstall the operator deployment when you delete a `Subscription` or `InstallPlan` in order to avoid accidental deletions of components when removing a subscription, such as if you no longer want automatic updates.
This means subscriptions orphan their `ClusterServiceVersions` when deleted, and that we must explicitly delete the `ClusterServiceVersions` it created to do an uninstall.

To perform an uninstall, you must ***REMOVED***rst delete the subscription, and then delete the related `ClusterServiceVersions` as the commands below demonstrate:

```
kubectl delete -n $METERING_NAMESPACE -f metering.subscription.yaml
kubectl delete -n $METERING_NAMESPACE clusterserviceversion-v1s -l operator-metering=true
```
