# Installing Operator Metering

Operator Metering is a collection of a few components:

- A Metering Operator Pod which aggregates Prometheus data and generates reports based
  on the collected usage information.
- Hive and Presto clusters, used by the Operator Metering Pod to perform queries on the
  collected usage data.

## Prerequisites

Operator Metering requires the following components:

- A Kubernetes 1.8 cluster.
- A StorageClass for dynamic volume provisioning. ([See con***REMOVED***guring metering][con***REMOVED***guring-metering] for more information.)
- A Prometheus installation within the cluster con***REMOVED***gured to do Kubernetes cluster-monitoring.
    - The prometheus-operator repository's [kube-prometheus instructions][kube-prometheus] are the standard way of achieving Prometheus cluster-monitoring.
    - At a minimum, we require kube-state-metrics, node-exporter, and built-in Kubernetes target metrics.
- 3.5GB Memory and 1.5 CPU Cores (1500 Millicores).
- At least 1 node with 1.5GB available memory (the highest memory request for a single Operator Metering Pod)
    - Memory and CPU consumption may often be lower, but will spike when running reports, or collecting data for larger clusters.
- A properly con***REMOVED***gured kubectl to access the Kubernetes cluster.

## Installation

First, start by creating your namespace:

```
export METERING_NAMESPACE=metering
kubectl create ns $METERING_NAMESPACE
```

### Con***REMOVED***guration

Before continuing with the installation, please read [Con***REMOVED***guring Operator Metering][con***REMOVED***guring-metering].
Some options may not be changed post-install. Be certain to con***REMOVED***gure these options, if desired, before installation.

If you're not using [kube-prometheus][kube-prometheus] installation, or your Prometheus service is not named `prometheus-k8s` and in the `monitoring` namespace, then you must customize the [prometheus URL con***REMOVED***g option][con***REMOVED***gure-prometheus-url] before proceeding.

If you do not wish to modify the Operator Metering con***REMOVED***guration, a minimal con***REMOVED***guration example that doesn't override anything can be found in [default.yaml][default-con***REMOVED***g].

### Install Operator Metering with Con***REMOVED***guration

Installation is a two step process. First, install the Metering Helm operator. Then, install the `Metering` resource that de***REMOVED***nes the con***REMOVED***guration.

To start, download the [Metering subscription][metering-subscription] and save it as `metering.subscription.yaml`, and download your `Metering` resource and save it as `metering.yaml`.

The subscription is used by the Operator Lifecycle Management and Catalog operators to install CRDs and the Metering Helm operator.

Install the subscription into the cluster:

```
kubectl create -n $METERING_NAMESPACE -f metering.subscription.yaml
```

This causes the operator-lifecycle-manager (OLM) to create an `InstallPlan` resource named after the `Subscription`.
The `InstallPlan` references a `ClusterServiceVersion` within it's catalog which describes the Metering Helm operator Deployment, Role, ServiceAccount, and CRD resources that need to be created.
The OLM operator will read the `ClusterServiceVersion` from it's catalog, and then create a `ClusterServiceVersion` named after our `InstallPlan`.
Once the `ClusterServiceVersion` exists, the operator creates the deployment containing our Metering Helm operator.


To verify this, run the following command:

```
kubectl get -n $METERING_NAMESPACE subscription-v1s,installplan-v1s,clusterserviceversion-v1s
```

You should see something like this in the output:

```
NAME                                                           AGE
subscription-v1.app.coreos.com/metering-helm-operator.v0.6.0   4m

NAME                                                                        AGE
installplan-v1.app.coreos.com/install-metering-helm-operator.v0.6.0-jhrr4   4m

NAME                                                                    AGE
clusterserviceversion-v1.app.coreos.com/metering-helm-operator.v0.6.0   4m
```

**Note: The Subscription, and InstallPlan resources declare an intent to perform an installation once. This means they do not ensure the ClusterServiceVersion exists after creating it the ***REMOVED***rst time, and deleting them will not result in the operator being uninstalled. For details on uninstall, see [Uninstalling Metering](#uninstalling-metering).**

Finally, install the `Metering` resource, which causes the Metering Helm operator to install and con***REMOVED***gure Metering and its dependencies.

```
kubectl create -n $METERING_NAMESPACE -f metering.yaml
```

## Verifying operation

First, wait until the Metering Helm operator deploys all of the Metering components:

```
kubectl get pods -n $METERING_NAMESPACE -l app=metering-helm-operator -o name | cut -d/ -f2 | xargs -I{} kubectl -n $METERING_NAMESPACE logs -f {} -c metering-helm-operator
```

When output similar to the following appears, the rest of the Pods should be initializing:

```
Waiting for Tiller to become ready

Getting pod metering-helm-operator-b5f86788c-ks4zq owner information
Querying for Deployment metering-helm-operator

LAST DEPLOYED: Fri Jan 26 19:18:34 2018
NAMESPACE: metering
STATUS: DEPLOYED

RESOURCES:

... the rest is omitted for brevity ...
```

Check the logs of the `metering` deployment for errors:

```
$ kubectl get pods -n $METERING_NAMESPACE -l app=metering -o name | cut -d/ -f2 | xargs -I{} kubectl -n $METERING_NAMESPACE logs {} -f
```

## Uninstalling Metering

The operator-lifecycle-manager (OLM) operator does not automatically uninstall the operator deployment when you delete a `Subscription` or `InstallPlan` in order to avoid accidental deletions of components when removing a subscription, such as if you no longer want automatic updates.
This means subscriptions orphan their `ClusterServiceVersions` when deleted, and that we must explicitly delete the `ClusterServiceVersions` it created to do an uninstall.

So perform an uninstall, you must ***REMOVED***rst delete the subscription, and then delete the related `ClusterServiceVersions` as the commands below demonstrate:

```
kubectl delete -n $METERING_NAMESPACE -f metering.subscription.yaml
kubectl delete -n $METERING_NAMESPACE clusterserviceversion-v1s -l operator-metering=true
```
