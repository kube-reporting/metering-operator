# This is the of***REMOVED***cial list of people who can contribute (and typically
# have contributed) code to the gomock repository.
# The AUTHORS ***REMOVED***le lists the copyright holders; this ***REMOVED***le
# lists people.  For example, Google employees are listed here
# but not in AUTHORS, because Google holds the copyright.
#
# The submission process automatically checks to make sure
# that people submitting code are listed in this ***REMOVED***le (by email address).
#
# Names should be added to this ***REMOVED***le only after verifying that
# the individual or the individual's organization has agreed to
# the appropriate Contributor License Agreement, found here:
#
#     http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html
#     http://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html
#
# The agreement for individuals can be ***REMOVED***lled out on the web.
#
# When adding J Random Contributor's name to this ***REMOVED***le,
# either J's name or J's organization's name should be
# added to the AUTHORS ***REMOVED***le, depending on whether the
# individual or corporate CLA was used.

# Names should be added to this ***REMOVED***le like so:
#     Name <email address>
#
# An entry with two email addresses speci***REMOVED***es that the
# ***REMOVED***rst address should be used in the submit logs and
# that the second address should be recognized as the
# same person when interacting with Rietveld.

# Please keep the list sorted.
