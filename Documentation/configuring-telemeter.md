# Con***REMOVED***guring Metering for use with Telemeter

[Telemeter](https://github.com/openshift/telemeter) is a service that implements a Prometheus federation service. Metrics can be collected across multiple clusters and worked with to do reporting of cluster resource availability, usage, etc. Metering comes with several built-in queries for consuming Telemeter data, but it is disabled by default and must be con***REMOVED***gured before use.

## Prometheus connection

By default, Metering will use the in-cluster Openshift Prometheus instance. It is necessary to change the certi***REMOVED***cate authority con***REMOVED***guration and Prometheus URL to point to the instance of Telemeter you wish to use. For detailed instructions, see [Prometheus connection](con***REMOVED***guring-reporting-operator.md#prometheus-url); however, it is likely that at least the authentication/certi***REMOVED***cate authority section and the Prometheus URL will need to be set.

## Installing Telemeter queries

Metering comes with queries built around working with Openshift cluster metrics. However, for use with Telemeter, these should be disabled and the optional Telemeter queries enabled:

```yaml
spec:
  # disable Openshift metric queries and reports
  openshift-reporting:
    enabled: false
  # enable Telemeter metric queries and reports
  telemeter-reporting:
    enabled: true
```

## Metering CR

A complete Metering con***REMOVED***guration resource with options set for connecting to a Telemeter Prometheus instance and using Telemeter queries will look somewhat as follows:

```yaml
# metering-telemeter.yaml
apiVersion: metering.openshift.io/v1alpha1
kind: Metering
metadata:
  name: operator-metering
spec:
  # disable Openshift metric queries and reports
  openshift-reporting:
    enabled: false
  # enable Telemeter metric queries and reports
  telemeter-reporting:
    enabled: true
  # con***REMOVED***gure connection to Telemeter Prometheus
  reporting-operator:
    spec:
      con***REMOVED***g:
        prometheusURL: "https://telemeter.api.mycompany.com"
        prometheusCerti***REMOVED***cateAuthority:
          # use system certi***REMOVED***cates instead of cluster service account
          useServiceAccountCA: false
        prometheusImporter:
          auth:
            # don't use in-cluster token authentication; instead use provided token
            useServiceAccountToken: false
            tokenSecret:
              enabled: true
              create: true
              value: "abc-123"
```
