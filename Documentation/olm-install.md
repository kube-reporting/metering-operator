# Installing Metering using Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)

Currently, installing Metering via OLM is only supported on OpenShift 4.x from the OpenShift Marketplace.
If you want to install Metering into a non-OpenShift Kubernetes cluster, use the [manual installation documentation][manual-install].

This procedure covers:
- Installing the metering-operator using the OperatorHub within the OpenShift web console
- Creating a Metering resource that defines the installation configuration for the rest of the Metering stack

## Installing the Metering Operator

Create a dedicated OpenShift project for Metering, and then install the Metering Operator:

1. Create a new project/namespace called *metering* using the OpenShift web console (navigate to **Project > Create Project**) or the `oc` command:

```
oc new-project metering
```

2. From the web console, click **Catalog > OperatorHub**, and search for *metering* to find the Metering Operator.

3. Click the Metering card to open its package description, then click **Install**.

4. In the **Create Operator Subscription** screen, select the *metering* namespace in the **A specific namespace on the cluster** drop-down, and specify your update channel and approval strategy. Click **Subscribe** to install the metering-operator into your selected namespace.

5. On the **Subscription Overview** screen, the **Upgrade status** indicates *1 installed* when the Metering Operator has finished installing. Click the *1 installed* (or *installed version*) link to view the ClusterServiceVersion overview for the metering-operator.

From the ClusterServiceVersion overview, you can create different resources related to Metering.

## Installing the Metering stack

Next, create a Metering resource that instructs the metering-operator to install the Metering stack in the namespace.

This resource holds all the top level configuration for each component (such as requests, limits, storage, etc.).

**IMPORTANT:**
There can only be one Metering resource in the namespace containing the metering-operator. Any other configuration is not supported.

1. From the web console, ensure you are on the ClusterServiceVersion overview page for the Metering project.
You can navigate to this page from **Catalog > Installed Operators**, then selecting the *Metering* operator.

2. Under **Provided APIs**, click **Create New** on the *Metering* card. This opens a YAML editor where you can define your Metering installation configuration.

3. Download the example [default.yaml][default-config] Metering resource and customize the YAML as desired. Enter your configuration into the YAML editor and click **Create**.

**NOTE:**
All supported configuration options are documented in [configuring metering][configuring-metering].

4. Navigate to **Workloads > Pods** and wait for your resources to be created and become ready.

Once all pods are ready, you can begin using Metering to collect information and report on your cluster.

**NOTE:**
For further reading on using Metering, see the [using Metering documentation][using-metering]. The Metering documentation refers to `$METERING_NAMESPACE` in most examples; this value will be `metering` if you followed the above instructions to create the Metering project/namespace.

## Manual/CLI based OLM install
